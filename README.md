# User Management System Using Express, MongoDB & EJS

A simple and efficient User Management System that demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. This project demonstrates the implementation of basic CRUD operations for user data, organized in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It includes features like environment variable configuration, code organization, and client-side components for enhanced functionality.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/onkaryemul/User-Management-System-Using-Express-MongoDB-EJS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   
   ```bash
     npm install
   ```


## Usage

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   Set up MongoDB: Please make sure you have a MongoDB instance running and update the connection string in the .env file.
   Create a config.env file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```env
     PORT=3001
     MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-uri
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-atlas-uri` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection URL.
   Make sure to replace placeholders like `yourusername` and `yourpassword` in the MongoDB URI with your actual MongoDB credentials.

2. **Start the application:**
   Open the terminal in the root directory and start the development server using the below command:

   ```bash
     nodemon server.js
   ```
   
3. **Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to access the application.**
